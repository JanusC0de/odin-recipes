# odin-recipes
In this project I am going to build a basic recipe website. 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Probably it wonâ€™t look very pretty by the time I've finished it, but this project is just to build my first HTML experiences. I am going to revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
